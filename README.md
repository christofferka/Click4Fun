# ðŸŽ‰ Click4Fun 

**Click4Fun** is a fun and interactive Java application built to boost your mood and stimulate your mind â€” one click at a time!  
The app lets users choose between three entertaining categories:

- ðŸ¤£ **Jokes**  
- ðŸ’¬ **Quotes**  
- ðŸ§  **Riddles**

After selecting a category, the app displays a random statement or teaser. The punchline, quote source, or riddle answer is only revealed when the user chooses to see it, making the experience playful and engaging.
